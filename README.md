# Aeronautics Data Engineering Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this fictional project, I assume the role of a data engineer at an innovative aeronautics consulting company. Our company excels in designing efficient airfoils for both planes and sports cars. While our talented data scientists specialize in machine learning algorithms, they depend on my expertise to handle ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks and construct robust ML (Machine Learning) pipelines.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Clean and model a modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset.

**Data Cleaning:** Eliminated duplicate rows and null values to ensure data integrity.

**ML Pipeline:** Created an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict SoundLevel based on various features.

**Model Evaluation:** Rigorously assessed the model's performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Model Persistence:** Implemented storage mechanisms to save the trained model for future use.

While this project is entirely fictional, it highlights my ability to seamlessly integrate machine learning algorithms with diverse datasets, showcasing the importance of ETL and ML pipeline construction in our imaginary aeronautics world. Dive into the code and documentation to explore the intricacies of this imaginative endeavor.
